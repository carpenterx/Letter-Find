# Letter Find
A site for generating letter find worksheets

The page can be found here: [https://carpenterx.github.io/Letter-Find/](https://carpenterx.github.io/Letter-Find/)

## About
The inspiration to create this site came from this video: [building a Kids Game in unity3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuH2f0knvh8). My goal was to allow users to generate these worksheets even if their alphabet contains different letters from the english one (such as my native language, for example).
